        You don't know babe<br>
        When you hold me<br>
        And kiss me slowly<br>
        It's the sweetest thing<br>
        And it don't change<br>
        If I had it my way<br>
        You would know that you are
        </p>

        <p>
        You're <a href="https://www.stumptowncoffee.com" target="_blank" title="어떤 커피?">the coffee</a> that I need in the morning<br>
        You're my sunshine in the rain when it's pouring<br>
        Won't you give yourself to me<br>
        Give it all, oh
        </p>

        <p>
        I just wanna see<br>
        I just wanna see how beautiful you are<br>
        You know that I see it<br>
        I know you're a star<br>
        Where you go I follow<br>
        No matter how far<br>
        If life is a movie<br>
        Oh you're the best part, oh oh oh<br>
        You're the best part, oh oh oh
        Best part
        </p>
